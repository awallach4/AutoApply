"""Phase 17.2 codex fix: narrow review_queue uniqueness to pending rows.

The original ``uq_review_queue_pending_per_snapshot`` constraint
applied to ALL statuses, not just pending. That caused a benign-
looking issue to ferment across multiple plan runs:

  Run 1: insert (t, j, s, status='pending') → approve → submit → row
         is now (t, j, s, 'submitted').
  Run 2: insert (t, j, s, status='pending') -- OK because no other
         pending row exists.
  Run 2 approve → tries to UPDATE to (t, j, s, 'approved') -- OK if
         no other approved row exists. But once submitted, the UPDATE
         to ``submitted`` collides with Run 1's row at the unique
         constraint and the operator's submit click hits an
         IntegrityError.

The fix is a **partial unique index** scoped to ``status = 'pending'``.
That preserves the orchestrator's "one pending row per snapshot"
idempotency without blocking downstream lifecycle transitions across
multiple runs. PostgreSQL supports partial indexes natively
(``CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ... WHERE``), so this migration replaces the
table-level UNIQUE with a partial unique index.
