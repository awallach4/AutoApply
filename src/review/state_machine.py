"""Phase 17.2: review queue state machine.

Five terminal-or-intermediate states, deliberately small so the kanban
board has fixed columns:

* ``pending``   -- created by ``application.prepare``; waiting for the
                   operator.
* ``approved``  -- operator has clicked Approve; the entry is now
                   queueable for ``application.fill`` / ``submit``.
* ``submitted`` -- ``application.submit`` succeeded (passing through
                   the Phase 17.5 pre-submit hard gate first).
* ``rejected``  -- operator declined. Terminal.
* ``stale``     -- Phase 17.5 gate found the snapshot expired or > 6h
                   stale and could not refresh in time. The entry
                   returns to the UI with a refresh-or-discard prompt.

Allowed transitions, declared as a frozen dict so callers can compare
their own transition rules to the canonical one without monkey-patching::

    pending   -> approved | rejected | stale | submitted
    approved  -> submitted | rejected | stale
    stale     -> pending | rejected
    submitted -> (terminal)
    rejected  -> (terminal)

The Phase 17.3 kanban board treats ``submitted`` + ``rejected`` as
terminal columns (no quick-action buttons); ``stale`` is rendered with
a refresh affordance that re-enqueues the materials task.
